<h1>Human Societies-From the Iceman to Us</h1>

<br> "I thought at first it was a doll's head," said Helmut Simon, a German tourist who, in 1991,
made one of the scientific finds of the century. Simon was hiking across a huge glacier in
southwest Austria near the Italian border when he stumbled upon a familiar shape protruding
from the melting ice. He soon realized that it was not a doll but a human body: the so-called
"Iceman," who died some 5,300 years ago, making him the oldest member of our species to be discovered essentially intact.

<br> Imagine you were born some 300 years ago, in the year 1700. Although this is very recent in
terms of the billions of years of the existence of planet Earth, you would still have been living in
a remarkably different world. You would never have been to a shopping mall. You would never
have <strong>encountered</strong> the world of cars, railways, airplanes, telephones, cameras, computers, and
TVs. And more than this, the idea of voting for your government, going to college, choosing
your religion, or even choosing your identity would all have been rare. Welcome to the modern world!

<br> Life has certainly changed in 300 years, and sociology was born out of a concern with this
rapidly changing character of the modern, industrial world: with where we have come from
and where we are heading. For sociologists, the term society means "all the people who <strong>interact</strong>
in a defined space and share culture." In this sense, both a continent like Europe and specific
individual countries such as Norway or Japan may be seen as societies.

<br> Even humans living thousands of years ago were members of early human societies.
<strong>Evidence</strong> of this comes from the discovery of the Iceman. Examining the Iceman's clothes,
scientists were astonished at how advanced this "caveman's" society was. The Iceman's hair was
neatly cut, and his body had numerous tattoos that probably <strong>symbolized</strong> his standing in the
community. He wore a skillfully sewn leather coat over which a grass cape provided even
greater protection from the weather. His shoes, also made of leather, were stuffed with grass for
comfort and warmth. He carried with him an axe, a wood-handled knife, and a bow that shot
feathered arrows with stone points. A primitive backpack held additional tools and personal
<strong>items</strong>, including natural medicines made from plants. It is <strong>estimated</strong> that he died some 5,300
years ago-before a great empire existed in Egypt, before the flowering of culture in ancient
Greece, and before any society in Europe built a single city. As people who take for granted
rapid transportation and instant <strong>global</strong> communication, we can look on this ancestor as a connection to our distant past.

<br> Sociologists have identified great differences among societies that have flourished and
<strong>declined</strong> throughout human history. They have observed how societies change over centuries
as the people in them gain greater ability to <strong>manipulate</strong> their natural <strong>environment</strong>.
Societies with basic technology can support only a small number of people who enjoy few
choices about how to live. Technologically <strong>complex</strong> societies-while not necessarily
"better" in any absolute sense-develop large populations; people in these societies are likely
to lead <strong>diverse</strong>, highly specialized lives.

<br> The greater the amount of technological skill and knowledge a society has, the faster the rate
at which the society changes. Technologically simple societies, then, change very slowly. Take,
for example, some of the clothing worn by the Austrian Iceman. It differs only slightly from
clothes used by shepherds in the same area of the world early in the twentieth century.
In <strong>contrast</strong> to simpler societies, industrial, technologically advanced societies change
so quickly that people witness remarkable <strong>transformations</strong> within their lifetimes.
Again, consider some familiar <strong>elements</strong> of <strong>contemporary</strong> culture that would probably
puzzle, delight, and possibly frighten people who lived just a few <strong>generations</strong> ago: fast food,
faxes, mobile phones, computer games, artificial hearts, fiber optics, test-tube babies, and many,
many others. Indeed it is a strange modern world we live in-even when compared with the
world of the recent past.

<br> Consider also the countless <strong>consequences</strong> of technological change. When our ancestors
first harnessed the power of the wind by using a sail, they set the stage for the invention of
kites, sailing ships, windmills, and, <strong>eventually</strong>, airplanes. We are only now beginning to see
how our modern lives are being changed by recent technologies like atomic energy or the computer.

<br> Sociologists divide societies into five types according to their technologies:
<ol>
  <li>hunting and gathering societies,</li>
  <li>horticultural and pastoral societies,</li>
  <li>agrarian societies,</li>
  <li>industrial societies, and</li>
  <li>post-industrial societies.</li>
</ol>
Hunting and gathering societies use simple technologies to gather food from nature,
such as hunting animals and picking berries. Horticultural and pastoral societies grow their
own plants and raise animals to eat. Agrarian societies-which first appeared around the
time of the Iceman-use technologies such as animal-drawn plows to farm on a larger scale.
Agrarian societies were also the first to develop such technological innovations as irrigation, the
wheel, writing, numbers, and expanded uses for metals. Industrial societies use technology that
powers sophisticated machinery with advanced <strong>sources</strong> of energy. Before the industrial era,
the major <strong>source</strong> of energy was the muscle power of humans and animals. In industrial
societies, people learn mechanical skills so that they can operate the machinery needed
to produce material goods. These societies <strong>transformed</strong> themselves more in a century than
previous societies had in thousands of years. Post-industrial societies-like the ones many of
us live in today-have developed technologies that support an information-based economy.
People in these societies create, process, store, and apply information through the use of
computers, fax machines, satellites, and other forms of communication technology.

<br> Technology has a big impact on a society, but in itself it is <strong>neutral</strong>. People are the ones who
decide how to use technology and whether it is used for good or bad purposes. Armed with the
<strong>capacity</strong> to reshape the world, human societies must understand both the social benefits and
problems caused by the desire for technological change. <strong>Furthermore</strong>, it is important to note
that the five types of societies described above do not <strong>evolve</strong> from one type to another in an
automatic process. In fact, in modern times, all of these societies may be said to coexist.
